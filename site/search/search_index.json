This powerful concept has numerous applications in a variety of fields, from  privacy to  blockchain technology.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of ZKPs, including their history, key concepts, and common applications. We'll also dive into the technical details of how ZKPs work, including the mathematics behind them and the different types of ZKP protocols. Along the way, we'll provide practical examples and use cases to help you understand how ZKPs can be used in real-world scenarios.</p> <p>At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of ZKPs and their cutting-edge applications, as well as the skills and knowledge to start exploring this exciting field further. So let's get started and discover the power of ZKPs!</p> <p>Special thanks for the outstanding ABCDE Team.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"content/","title":"Content","text":"<p>Here's the content for our ABCDE ZK Tutorial, which includes 12 chapters:</p> <ul> <li>Introduction</li> <li>Mathematical Foundation</li> <li>SNARK </li> <li>PLONK</li> <li>Recursive SNARKs, Aggregation and Accumulation</li> <li>Usecase1: zkRollup and zkEVM</li> <li>Usecase2: zkBridge</li> <li>Usecase3: zkml</li> <li>ZK accelerations</li> </ul>"}]}
